# Training

## Root technologies 
Rather than adopting specific solutions or framworks, we choose to focus on core technologies. This approach facilitates the sharing of ideas and experience across projects and cross-project collaboration. It fosters re-use of solutions and experience. It makes it easier for team members to move between projects.

## HTML

## CSS
- Customization of CSS rules is the simplest way to make our projects distinct and match our graphic identity.

## JavaScript
- JS is our preferred scripting language for projects.  

## Python
- Python numerical calculations, data analytics, databases, spatial analysis
## R

## Skills
