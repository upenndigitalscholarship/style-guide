# project stages 

1. Planning
    - The process begins with the RDDS project form 
    - identify internal stakeholders including subject librarians and global collections
    - identify comparable projects, site designs we/they like other reference points
    - ux design workshop to establish user problems and needs, prioritize use cases and features (scope), define successful outcomes and goals
    - grants, identify relevant grants and needs.
    - Wireframing and data models  
    - Assess best solutions and technologies to use given project requirements, people and goals. Is this a project that RDDS can or should support? Does it match our values as a team? Provide opportunities to inovate and explore?
    - Planning ends with a completed project charter documenting everything above

2. Development
    - Development begins with a project manager and regular project team check-ins
    - Project team training and capacity building. Basically projects offer professional development and mentoring opportunities as well as work in existing areas of expertise for all project partners. 
    - content creation and editing
    - Dev work leading to minimal viable product, with opportunities for pair-programming, sharing and feedback. 
    - Documentation should be sufficent to guide new participants 
    - Testing for RDDS priorities: visible citation of project partners, accessibility, inclusive language, access to data, RDDS visual identity and TBD.  
    - Development ends when an Alpha version of the project is complete. It is a complete first draft of the project. Development ends when the project team agrees that the project is ready to share with external users. 

3. Deployment 
    - Deployment begins with the Beta version of the project and the publishing of project applications, software and data.
    - At this point, all applications and web content should be "flattened" to static sites.  
    - If possible, project data should be published as a dataset 
    - User testing and feedback
    - Creation of a project sustainability plan (see https://sites.haa.pitt.edu/sustainabilityroadmap/)
    - Deployment ends with a production version of the project 

4. Maintenance (3-year cycle)
    - Versioned updates of content and data 
    - versioned DOIs
    - Support for communications and promotion, conference presentations, workshops
    - Grant reporting and whitepapers
    - Preservation planning to archive data and project outcomes
