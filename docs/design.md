# design principles
- data is our alpha and omega
- make modular over integrated systems
- static sites break less  
- microservices over apps
- design for re-use, not one-time solutions 
- always try something new in a project
- ownership, if the lights go out, have the switch to turn them back on


**"The Hedgehog and the fox" (redux)**

There once were two forest animals who lived two very different lives. The hedgehog lived a very consistent life.  He new exactly where to forage for food and how best to keep it safe.  He'd go back year after year.  He did things the same way because it made life predictable and secure.  He knew one thing and he knew it better than anyone else. Because of this way of being, the hedgehog had time to explore other interests and made small improvements to his routine over the years, but never felt uncertain or afraid that he'd have no food. He was also incredibly dull.  

The fox was a very different creature.  She dashed into the farm to steal eggs from the chickens.  The next moment she'd be knawing on berries in a glade. She lived in the moment and was free to go where she pleased. Each day brought unexpected challenges and puzzles. She was always up to something new and in novel ways. But she had to start from scratch often and most often things didn't work out the way she'd planned. 

One day, a young owl fell out of its nest.  It sat on the ground watching the other animals.  The hedgehog and the fox caught its attention in particular because they lived such different lives.  One was drearily consistent, but reliable.  The other was clever and fast, but nervous things wouldn't work out.

The owl wanted to be something in between. It wanted the best of both sides, while avoiding all the problems.  The hedgehog just did one thing. So the owl decided "I'm never going to get stuck doing things one way or another, no matter how confident and secure I might feel." But "I have to know some things better than others. I can't just dash about pretending that I can do anything and hope things just will work out."

It was getting dark and the owl needed to get back to the nest. 

The owl decided to learn JavaScript and Python.  It wasn't against Ruby, but three was too many things to know.  Lots of animals know PHP, but let them be them.
