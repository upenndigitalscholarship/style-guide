# RDDS style guide

This guide outlines our prefered ways of making. It connects our practices with our values.  It provides clarity and direction. It should be energizing and helpful, not  constricting. This style is our current thinking on how to do things right and make things better. It is always evolving.   

1. values 
    - minimal - start simple to be sustainable, accessible and global
    - creative - hold space for odd ideas and new inputs
    - communal - make for community and people's needs
    - ephemeral - permanent isn't possible, live in the now 
    - centered - build from us, not in response to others 
    - fun - if noone likes it, it won't get done

2. design principles
    - data is our alpha and omega
    - make modular over integrated systems
    - static sites break less  
    - microservices over apps
    - design for re-use not one-time solutions 
    - always try something new in a project

3. common project types 
    - mapping
    - exhibits 
    - collaborative research collections
    - digital editions 
    - publications 
    - community-engaged
