# values 
- minimal - start simple to be sustainable, accessible, and global
- creative - hold space for odd ideas and new inputs
- communal - make for community and people's needs
- ephemeral - permanent isn't possible; let's revisit every three years 
- centered - build from us, not in response to others 
- fun - if we don't like it, it won't get done
