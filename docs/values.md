# values 
- minimal - start simple to be sustainable, accessible and global
- creative - hold space for odd ideas and new inputs
- communal - make for community and people's needs
- ephemeral - permanent isn't possible, live in the now 
- centered - build from us, not in response to others 
- fun - if noone likes it, it won't get done
